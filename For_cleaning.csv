that
is
a
funny
game
uncle
what
did
you
do
then
a
red
pawn
took
a
white
pawn
this
way
you
see
alice
the
chessboard
is
divided
into
sixty-four
squares
red
and
white
and
the
white
army
tries
to
win
and
the
red
army
tries
to
win
it
is
like
a
battle
with
soldiers
yes
here
are
the
kings
and
queens
they
are
fighting
for
that
is
the
red
queen
and
here
is
the
white
queen.how
funny
they
look
see
the
crowns
on
their
heads
and
look
at
their
big
feet.it
is
a
foot
apiece
that
is
what
it
is
do
they
hump
along
like
this
here
you
are
spoiling
the
game
i
must
keep
them
all
in
their
right
squares.i
want
to
be
a
queen
here
you
are
he
points
to
a
small
white
pawn
here
you
are
in
your
little
stiff
skirt
how
do
you
do
alice
and
now
you
are
going
to
move
here.let
me
move
myself.when
you
have
traveled
all
along
the
board
this
way
and
have
not
been
taken
by
the
enemy
you
may
be
a
queen.why
do
people
always
play
with
kings
and
queens
mother
has
them
in
her
playing
cards
too
look
here
is
the
king
of
hearts
and
here
is
his
wife
she
is
the
queen
of
hearts—is
not
she
cross-looking
wants
to
bite
one
’
s
head
off.you
are
playing
against
yourself
are
not
you
that
is
one
way
of
keeping
in
practice
alice
i
have
friends
in
the
university
who
want
to
beat
me.but
if
you
play
against
yourself
i
should
think
you
would
want
to
cheat
does
a
nice
little
girl
like
you
cheat
when
she
plays
against
herself
oh
i
never
do
i
would
scold
myself
hard
i
always
pretend
i
am
two
people
too
it
is
lots
of
fun
is
not
it
sometimes
when
i
am
all
alone
i
walk
up
to
the
looking
glass
and
talk
to
the
other
alice
she
is
so
silly
that
alice
she
can
not
do
anything
by
herself
she
just
mocks
me
all
the
time
when
i
laugh
she
laughs
when
i
point
my
finger
at
her
she
points
her
finger
at
me
and
when
i
stick
my
tongue
out
at
her
she
sticks
her
tongue
out
at
me
kitty
has
a
twin
too
have
not
you
darling
i
will
have
to
write
a
book
some
day
about
alice—alice
in
wonderland
“
child
of
the
pure
unclouded
brow
and
dreaming
eyes
of
wonder
”
or
alice
through
the
looking
glass
do
not
you
wish
sometimes
you
could
go
into
looking-glass
house
see
there
is
the
room
you
can
see
through
the
glass
it
is
just
the
same
as
our
living-room
here
only
the
things
go
the
other
way
i
can
see
all
of
it—all
but
the
bit
just
behind
the
fireplace
oh
i
do
wish
i
could
see
that
bit
i
want
so
much
to
know
if
they
have
a
fire
there
you
never
can
tell
you
know
unless
our
fire
smokes
then
smoke
comes
up
in
that
room
too—but
that
may
be
just
to
make
it
look
as
if
they
had
a
fire—just
to
pretend
they
had
the
books
are
something
like
our
books
pg
5
only
the
words
go
the
wrong
way
will
not
there
ever
be
any
way
of
our
getting
through
uncle
do
you
think
kitty
would
find
looking-glass
milk
digestible
it
does
not
sound
awful
good
does
it
but
i
might
leave
her
at
home
she
is
been
into
an
awful
lot
of
mischief
today
she
found
sister
’
s
knitting
and
chased
the
ball
all
over
the
garden
where
sister
was
playing
croquet
with
the
neighbors
and
i
ran
and
ran
after
the
naughty
little
thing
until
i
was
all
out
of
breath
and
so
tired
i
am
tired.take
a
nap
yes
you
have
time
before
tea.we
are
going
to
have
mock
turtle
soup
for
supper
i
heard
mamma
tell
the
cook
not
to
pepper
it
too
much.what
a
funny
little
rabbit
it
is
nibbling
all
the
time
there
she
is
let
us
call
her
over.do
you
think
she
will
come
i
will
call
softly
alice
hist
alice.alice
hush—if
she
wakes
and
catches
us—alice
come
through
into
looking-glass
house
i—do
not—know—how—i—can—get—through
i
have
tried—before—but
the
glass
was
hard—and
i
was
afraid
of
cutting—my
fingers—why
it
is
soft
like
gauze
it
is
turning
into
a
sort
of
mist
why
it
is
easy
to
get
through
why—why—i
am
going
through
why
you
are
the
red
queen
of
course
i
am
where
do
you
come
from
and
where
are
you
going
look
up
speak
nicely
and
do
not
twiddle
your
fingers
i
only
wanted
to
see
what
the
looking
glass
was
like
perhaps
i
have
lost
my
way.i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
your
way
all
the
ways
about
here
belong
to
me
curtsey
while
you
are
thinking
what
to
say
it
saves
time.i
will
try
it
when
i
go
home
the
next
time
i
am
a
little
late
for
dinner.it
is
time
for
you
to
answer
now
open
your
mouth
a
little
wider
when
you
speak
and
always
say
“
your
majesty.
”
i
suppose
you
do
not
want
to
lose
your
name
no
indeed.and
yet
i
do
not
know
only
think
how
convenient
it
would
be
if
you
could
manage
to
go
home
without
it
for
instance
if
the
governess
wanted
to
call
you
to
your
lessons
she
would
call
out
“
come
here
”
and
there
she
would
have
to
leave
off
because
there
would
not
be
any
name
for
her
to
call
and
of
course
you
would
not
have
to
go
you
know.that
would
never
do
i
am
sure
the
governess
would
never
think
of
excusing
me
from
lessons
for
that
if
she
could
not
remember
my
name
she
would
call
me
“
miss
”
as
the
servants
do.well
if
she
said
“
miss
”
and
did
not
say
anything
more
of
course
you
would
miss
your
lessons
i
dare
say
you
can
not
even
read
this
book.it
is
all
in
some
language
i
do
not
know
why
it
is
a
looking-glass
book
of
course
and
if
i
hold
it
up
to
a
glass
the
words
will
all
go
the
right
way
again.it
seems
very
pretty
but
it
is
rather
hard
to
understand
somehow
it
seems
to
fill
my
head
with
ideas—only
i
do
not
exactly
know
what
they
are.i
daresay
you
do
not
know
your
geography
either
look
at
the
map
it
is
marked
out
just
like
a
big
chessboard
i
would
not
mind
being
a
pawn
though
of
course
i
should
like
to
be
a
red
queen
best.that
is
easily
managed
when
you
get
to
the
eighth
square
you
will
be
a
queen
it
is
a
huge
game
of
chess
that
is
being
played—all
over
the
world
come
on
we
have
got
to
run
faster
do
not
try
to
talk.i
can
not
.faster
faster.are
we
nearly
there
nearly
there
why
we
passed
it
ten
minutes
ago
faster
you
may
rest
a
little
now.why
i
do
believe
we
are
in
the
same
place
everything
’
s
just
as
it
was.of
course
it
is
what
would
you
have
it
well
in
our
country
you
would
generally
get
to
somewhere
else—if
you
ran
very
fast
for
a
long
time
as
we
have
been
doing.a
slow
sort
of
country
now
here
you
see
it
takes
all
the
running
you
can
do
to
keep
in
the
same
place
if
you
want
to
get
somewhere
else
you
must
run
at
least
twice
as
fast
as
that.i
would
rather
not
try
please
i
am
quite
content
to
stay
here—only
i
am
so
hot
and
thirsty.i
know
what
you
would
like.have
a
biscuit
while
you
are
refreshing
yourself
i
will
just
take
the
measurements.at
the
end
of
two
yards
i
shall
give
you
your
directions—have
another
biscuit
no
thank
you
one
’
s
quite
enough.thirst
quenched
i
hope
at
the
end
of
three
yards
i
shall
repeat
them—for
fear
of
your
forgetting
them
at
the
end
of
four
i
shall
say
good-bye
and
at
the
end
of
five
i
shall
go
that
square
belongs
to
humpty
dumpty
and
that
square
to
the
gryphon
and
mock
turtle
and
that
square
to
the
queen
of
hearts
but
you
make
no
remark
i—i
did
not
know
i
had
to
make
one—just
then.you
should
have
said
“
it
is
extremely
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
all
this
”
however
we
will
suppose
it
said
four
good-bye
five
oh
the
duchess
the
duchess
oh
will
not
she
be
savage
if
i
have
kept
her
waiting
i
have
never
seen
a
rabbit
with
a
waistcoat
and
a
watch
and
a
waistcoat
pocket
if
you
please
sir—oh
i
am
very
glad
i
happened
to
be
in
the
way.bread-and-butter
bread-and-butter.am
i
addressing
the
white
queen
well
yes
if
you
call
that
a-dressing
it
is
not
my
notion
of
the
thing
at
all.if
your
majesty
will
only
tell
me
the
right
way
to
begin
i
will
do
it
as
well
as
i
can.but
i
do
not
want
it
done
at
all
i
have
been
a-dressing
myself
for
the
last
two
hours.every
single
thing
’
s
crooked
and
you
are
all
over
pins
may
i
put
your
shawl
straight
for
you
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
it
it
is
out
of
temper
i
have
pinned
it
here
and
i
have
pinned
it
there
but
there
is
no
pleasing
it.it
can
not
go
straight
you
know
if
you
pin
it
all
on
one
side
and
dear
me
what
a
state
your
hair
is
in
the
brush
has
got
entangled
in
it
and
i
lost
the
comb
yesterday.you
look
better
now
but
really
you
should
have
a
lady
’
s
maid
i
am
sure
i
will
take
you
with
pleasure
two
pence
a
week
and
jam
every
other
day.i
do
not
want
you
to
hire
me—and
i
do
not
care
for
jam.it
is
very
good
jam.well
i
do
not
want
any
today
at
any
rate.you
could
not
have
it
if
you
did
want
it
the
rule
is
jam
tomorrow
and
jam
yesterday—but
never
jam
today.it
must
come
sometimes
to
“
jam
today.
”
no
it
can
not
it
is
jam
every
other
day
today
is
not
any
other
day
you
know.i
do
not
understand
you
it
is
dreadfully
confusing
that
is
the
effect
of
living
backwards
it
always
makes
one
a
little
giddy
at
first—living
backwards
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
but
there
is
one
great
advantage
in
it—that
one
’
s
memory
works
both
ways.i
am
sure
mine
only
works
one
way
i
can
not
remember
things
before
they
happen.it
is
a
poor
sort
of
memory
that
only
works
backwards.what
sort
of
things
do
you
remember
best
oh
things
that
happened
the
week
after
next
for
instance
now
there
is
the
king
’
s
messenger—he
is
in
prison
being
punished
and
the
trial
does
not
even
begin
till
next
wednesday
and
of
course
the
crime
comes
last
of
all.suppose
he
never
commits
the
crime
that
would
be
all
the
better
would
not
it
of
course
it
would
be
all
the
better
but
it
would
not
be
all
the
better
his
being
punished.you
are
wrong
there
at
any
rate
were
you
ever
punished
only
for
faults.and
you
were
all
the
better
for
it
i
know
yes
but
then
i
had
done
the
things
i
was
punished
for
that
makes
all
the
difference.but
if
you
had
not
done
them
that
would
have
been
better
still
better
and
better
and
better
there
is
a
mistake
somewhere—oh
oh
oh
my
finger
’
s
bleeding
oh
oh
oh
what
is
the
matter
have
you
pricked
your
finger
i
have
not
pricked
it
yet—but
i
soon
shall—oh
oh
oh
when
do
you
expect
to
do
it
when
i
fasten
my
shawl
again
the
brooch
will
come
undone
directly
oh
oh
take
care
you
are
holding
it
all
crooked
that
accounts
for
the
bleeding
you
see
now
you
understand
the
way
things
happen
here.but
why
do
not
you
scream
now
why
i
have
done
all
the
screaming
already
what
would
be
the
good
of
having
it
all
over
again
oh
it
is
time
to
run
if
you
want
to
stay
in
the
same
place
come
on
no
no
not
so
fast
i
am
getting
dizzy
faster
faster
everything
’
s
black
before
my
eyes
oh
my
head
where
am
i
oh
dear
oh
dear
pg
22
i
have
never
been
smaller
than
any
table
before
i
have
always
been
able
to
reach
the
knobs
what
a
curious
feeling
oh
i
am
shrinking
it
is
the
fan—the
gloves
oh
saved
in
time
but
i
never—never—oh
my
fan
and
gloves
where
are
my—oh
mr.
rabbit—please
help
me
out—i
want
to
go
home—i
want
to
go
home—oh
the
duchess
oh
my
fur
and
whiskers
she
will
get
me
executed
as
sure
as
ferrets
are
ferrets
oh
you
have
them
i
am
sorry—you
dropped
them
you
know—she
will
chop
off
your
head
if
you
please
sir—where
am
i
—will
not
you
please—tell
me
how
to
get
out—i
want
to
get
out—oh
my
ears
and
whiskers
how
late
it
is
getting.it
is
a
rabbit-hole—i
am
small
enough
to
fit
it
too
if
i
shrink
any
more
it
might
end
in
my
going
out
altogether
like
a
candle
i
wonder
what
i
would
be
like
then
what
does
the
flame
of
a
candle
look
like
after
the
candle
is
blown
out
i
have
never
seen
such
a
thing
do
not
stand
chattering
to
yourself
like
that
but
tell
me
your
name
and
your
business.my
name
is
alice
but—it
is
a
stupid
name
enough
what
does
it
mean
must
a
name
mean
something
of
course
it
must
my
name
means
the
shape
i
am—and
a
good
handsome
shape
it
is
too
with
a
name
like
yours
you
might
be
any
shape
almost.you
are
humpty
dumpty
just
like
an
egg.it
is
very
provoking
to
be
called
an
egg—very.i
said
you
looked
like
an
egg
sir
and
some
eggs
are
very
pretty
you
know.some
people
have
no
more
sense
than
a
baby.why
do
you
sit
here
all
alone
why
because
there
is
nobody
with
me
did
you
think
i
did
not
know
the
answer
to
that
ask
another.do
not
you
think
you
would
be
safer
down
on
the
ground
that
wall
’
s
so
very
narrow.what
tremendously
easy
riddles
you
ask
of
course
i
do
not
think
so
take
a
good
look
at
me
i
am
one
that
has
spoken
to
a
king
i
am
to
show
you
i
am
not
proud
you
may
shake
hands
with
me
however
this
conversation
is
going
on
a
little
too
fast
let
us
go
back
to
the
last
remark
but
one.i
am
afraid
i
can
not
remember
it.in
that
case
we
start
fresh
and
it
is
my
turn
to
choose
a
subject.you
talk
about
it
just
as
if
it
were
a
game.so
here
is
a
question
for
you
how
old
did
you
say
you
were
seven
years
and
six
months.wrong
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
now
if
you
would
asked
my
advice
i
would
have
said
“
leave
off
at
seven—but—
”
i
never
ask
advice
about
growing.too
proud
what
a
beautiful
belt
you
have
got
on
at
least
a
beautiful
cravat
i
should
have
said—no
a
belt
i
mean—i
beg
your
pardon
if
only
i
knew
which
was
neck
and
which
was
waist.it
is
a—most—provoking—thing
when
a
person
does
not
know
a
cravat
from
a
belt.i
know
it
is
very
ignorant
of
me.it
is
a
cravat
child
and
a
beautiful
one
as
you
say
there
is
glory
for
you.i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
by
“
glory.
”
when
i
use
a
word
it
means
just
what
i
choose
it
to
mean—neither
more
nor
less.the
question
is
whether
you
can
make
words
mean
different
things.the
question
is
which
is
to
be
master—that
is
all
impenetrability
that
is
what
i
say
would
you
tell
me
please
what
that
means
i
meant
by
“
impenetrability
”
that
we
have
had
enough
of
that
subject
and
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
you
would
mention
what
you
mean
to
do
next
as
i
suppose
you
do
not
mean
to
stop
here
all
the
rest
of
your
life.that
is
a
great
deal
to
make
one
word
mean.when
i
make
a
word
do
a
lot
of
work
like
that
i
always
pay
it
extra.oh
ah
you
should
see
them
come
round
me
of
a
saturday
night
for
to
get
their
wages
you
know
that
is
all—good-bye.good-bye
till
we
meet
again.i
should
not
know
you
again
if
we
did
meet
you
are
so
exactly
like
other
people.the
face
is
what
one
goes
by
generally.that
is
just
what
i
complain
of
your
face
is
the
same
as
everybody
has—the
two
eyes—so—nose
in
the
middle
mouth
under
it
is
always
the
same
now
if
you
had
the
two
eyes
on
the
same
side
of
the
nose
for
instance—or
the
mouth
at
the
top—that
would
be
some
help.it
would
not
look
nice.wait
till
you
have
tried
good-bye.oh
i
forgot
to
ask
him
how
to—it
is
not
marked
poison.this
is
good
tastes
like
cherry
tart
custard
pineapple
roast
turkey
toffy
and
hot
buttered
toast—all
together
oh
oh
i
am
letting
out
like
a
telescope.but
the
lake
is
rising
too
oh
oh
it
is
deep
i
am
drowning
help
help
i
am
drowning
i
am
drowning
in
my
tears
hjckrrh
hjckrrh
hjckrrh
hjckrrh
hjckrrh.drop
your
tears
into
the
sea
with
his.he
sobs
as
if
he
had
a
bone
in
his
throat
he
sighs
as
if
his
heart
would
break
what
is
his
sorrow
oh
gryphon
it
is
terrible
it
is
all
his
fancy
that
mock
turtle
has
not
got
no
sorrow
this
here
young
lady
she
wants
for
to
know
your
history
she
do.i
will
tell
it
her
sit
down
both
of
you
and
do
not
speak
a
word
till
i
have
finished.i
do
not
see
how
you
can
ever
finish
if
you
do
not
begin.once
i
was
a
real
turtle.when
we
were
little
we
went
to
school
in
the
sea
the
master
was
an
old
turtle—we
used
to
call
him
tortoise—why
did
you
call
him
tortoise
if
he
was
not
one
we
called
him
tortoise
because
he
taught
us
really
you
are
very
dull.you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
asking
such
a
simple
question
drive
on
old
fellow
do
not
be
all
day
about
it
yes
we
went
to
school
in
the
sea
though
’
you
may
not
believe
it—i
never
said
i
did
not.you
did.hold
your
tongue
we
had
the
best
of
educations—in
fact
we
went
to
school
every
day.i
have
been
to
a
day
school
too
you
need
not
be
so
proud
as
all
that.with
extras
yes
we
learned
french
and
music.and
washing
certainly
not
ah
then
yours
was
not
a
really
good
school
now
at
ours
they
had
at
the
end
of
the
bill
french
music
and
washing—extra.you
could
not
have
wanted
it
much
living
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea.i
could
not
afford
to
learn
it
i
only
took
the
regular
course.what
was
that
reeling
and
writhing
of
course
to
begin
with
and
then
the
different
branches
of
arithmetic—ambition
distraction
uglification
and
derision.i
never
heard
of
uglification
what
is
it
never
heard
of
uglifying
you
know
what
to
beautify
is
i
suppose
yes
it
means—to—make—anything—prettier.well
then
if
you
do
not
know
what
to
uglify
is
you
are
a
simpleton.what
else
had
you
to
learn
well
there
was
mystery
mystery
ancient
and
modern
with
seaography
then
drawling—the
drawling-master
was
an
old
conger
eel
that
used
to
come
once
a
week
what
he
taught
us
was
drawling
stretching
and
fainting
in
coils.what
was
that
like
well
i
can
not
show
it
you
myself
i
am
too
stiff
and
the
gryphon
never
learned
it.had
not
time
i
went
to
the
classical
master
though
he
was
an
old
crab
he
was.i
never
went
to
him
he
taught
laughing
and
grief
they
used
to
say.so
he
did
so
he
did.and
how
many
hours
a
day
did
you
do
lessons
ten
hours
the
first
day
nine
the
next
and
so
on.what
a
curious
plan
that
is
the
reason
they
are
called
lessons
because
they
lessen
from
day
to
day.then
the
eleventh
day
must
have
been
a
holiday
of
course
it
was.and
how
did
you
manage
on
the
twelfth
that
is
enough
about
lessons
tell
her
something
about
the
games
now.same
as
if
he
had
a
bone
in
his
throat.you
may
not
have
lived
much
under
the
sea—i
have
not.and
perhaps
you
were
never
even
introduced
to
a
lobster.i
once
tasted—no
never
so
you
can
have
no
idea
what
a
delightful
thing
a
lobster
quadrille
is.no
indeed
what
sort
of
a
dance
is
it
why
you
first
form
into
a
line
along
the
seashore.two
lines
seals
turtles
salmon
and
so
on
then
when
you
have
cleared
all
the
jellyfish
out
of
the
way—that
generally
takes
some
time.you
advance
twice—each
with
a
lobster
as
a
partner.of
course
advance
twice
set
to
partners.change
lobsters
and
retire
in
same
order.then
you
know
you
throw
the—the
lobsters
as
far
out
to
sea
as
you
can—swim
after
them
turn
a
somersault
in
the
sea.change
lobsters
again
back
to
land
again
and—that
is
all
the
first
figure.it
must
be
a
very
pretty
dance.would
you
like
to
see
a
little
of
it
very
much
indeed.come
let
us
try
the
first
figure
we
can
do
it
without
lobsters
you
know
which
shall
sing
oh
you
sing
i
have
forgotten
the
words.thank
you
it
is
a
very
interesting
dance
to
watch
and
i
do
so
like
that
curious
song
about
the
whiting.oh
as
to
the
whiting
they—you
have
seen
them
of
course
yes
i
have
often
seen
them
at
din—i
do
not
know
where
din
may
be
but
if
you
have
seen
them
so
often
of
course
you
know
what
they
are
like.i
believe
so
they
have
their
tails
in
their
mouths—and
they
are
all
over
crumbs.you
are
wrong
about
the
crumbs
crumbs
would
all
wash
off
in
the
sea
but
they
have
their
tails
in
their
mouths
and
the
reason
is—tell
her
about
the
reason
and
all
that.the
reason
is
that
they
would
go
with
the
lobsters
to
the
dance
so
they
got
thrown
out
to
sea
so
they
had
to
fall
a
long
way
so
they
got
their
tails
fast
in
their
mouths
so
they
could
not
get
them
out
again
that
is
all.thank
you
it
is
very
interesting
i
never
knew
so
much
about
a
whiting
before.i
can
tell
you
more
than
that
if
you
like
do
you
know
why
it
is
called
a
whiting
i
never
thought
about
it
why
it
does
the
boots
and
shoes.does
the
boots
and
shoes
why
what
are
your
shoes
done
with
i
mean
what
makes
them
so
shiny
they
are
done
with
blacking
i
believe.boots
and
shoes
under
the
sea
are
done
with
whiting
now
you
know.and
what
are
they
made
of
soles
and
eels
of
course
any
shrimp
could
have
told
you
that.if
i
would
been
the
whiting
i
would
have
said
to
the
porpoise
“
keep
back
please
we
do
not
want
you
with
us.
”
they
were
obliged
to
have
him
with
them
no
wise
fish
would
go
anywhere
without
a
porpoise.would
not
it
really
of
course
not
why
if
a
fish
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
was
going
a
journey
i
should
say
“
with
what
porpoise
”
do
not
you
mean
purpose
i
mean
what
i
say.shall
we
try
another
figure
of
the
lobster
quadrille
or
would
you
like
the
mock

room
i
do
not
know
who
you
are.i
am
the
march
hare
that
is
the
hatter
and
this
is
the
dormouse
have
some
wine
i
do
not
see
any
wine.there
is
not
any.then
it
was
not
very
civil
of
you
to
offer
it.it
was
not
very
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
being
invited.i
did
not
know
it
was
your
table
it
is
laid
for
a
great
many
more
than
three.your
hair
wants
cutting.you
should
learn
not
to
make
personal
remarks
it
is
very
rude.why
is
a
raven
like
a
writing-desk
come
we
shall
have
some
fun
now
i
am
glad
you
have
begun
asking
riddles—i
believe
i
can
guess
that.so
you
mean
that
you
think
you
can
find
out
the
answer
to
it
exactly
so.then
you
should
say
what
you
mean.i
do
at
least—at
least
i
mean
what
i
say—that
is
the
same
thing
you
know.not
the
same
thing
a
bit
why
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
“
i
see
what
i
eat
”
is
the
same
thing
as
“
i
eat
what
i
see
”
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
“
i
like
what
i
get
”
is
the
same
thing
as
“
i
get
what
i
like.
”
you
might
just
as
well
say
that
“
i
breathe
when
i
sleep
”
is
the
same
thing
as
“
i
sleep
when
i
breathe.
”
it
is
the
same
thing
with
you
pg
50
what
day
of
the
month
is
it
the
fourth.two
days
wrong
i
told
you
butter
would
not
suit
the
works
it
was
the
best
butter.yes
but
some
crumbs
must
have
got
in
as
well
you
should
not
have
put
it
in
with
the
bread-knife—it
was
the
best
butter
you
know.what
a
funny
watch
it
tells
the
day
of
the
month
and
does
not
tell
what
of
the
clock
it
is.why
should
it
does
your
watch
tell
you
what
year
it
is
of
course
not
but
that
is
because
it
stays
the
same
year
for
such
a
long
time
together.which
is
just
the
case
with
mine.i
do
not
quite
understand
you
what
you
said
had
no
sort
of
meaning
in
it
and
yet
it
was
certainly
english.the
dormouse
is
asleep
again.of
course
of
course
just
what
i
was
going
to
remark
myself.have
you
guessed
the
riddle
yet
no
i
give
it
up
what
is
the
answer
i
have
not
the
slightest
idea.nor
i.i
think
you
might
do
something
better
with
the
time
than
wasting
it
in
asking
riddles
that
have
no
answers.if
you
knew
time
as
well
as
i
do
you
would
not
talk
about
wasting
it
it
is
him.i
do
not
know
what
you
mean.of
course
you
do
not
i
dare
say
you
never
even
spoke
to
time.perhaps
not
but
i
know
i
have
to
beat
time
when
i
learn
music.ah
that
accounts
for
it
he
will
not
stand
beating
now
if
you
only
kept
on
good
terms
with
him
he
would
do
almost
anything
you
liked
with
the
clock
for
instance
suppose
it
were
nine
of
the
clock
in
the
morning
just
time
to
begin
lessons
you
would
only
have
to
whisper
a
hint
to
time
and
round
goes
the
clock
in
a
twinkling
half
past
one
time
for
dinner.i
only
wish
it
was.that
would
be
grand
certainly
but
then—i
should
not
be
hungry
for
it
you
know.not
at
first
perhaps
but
you
could
keep
it
to
half
past
one
as
long
as
you
liked.is
that
the
way
you
manage
not
i
we
quarreled
last
march—just
before
he
went
mad
you
know
it
was
at
the
great
concert
given
by
the
queen
of
hearts
and
i
had
to
sing.you
know
the
song
perhaps.i
have
heard
something
like
it.twinkle
twinkle
twinkle—well
i
would
hardly
finished
the
first
verse
when
the
queen
bawled
out
“
he
is
murdering
the
time
off
with
his
head
”
how
dreadfully
savage
and
ever
since
that
he
will
not
do
a
thing
i
ask
it
is
always
six
of
the
clock
now.is
that
the
reason
so
many
tea
things
are
put
out
here
yes
that
is
it
it
is
always
tea
time
and
we
have
no
time
to
wash
the
things
between
whiles.then
you
keep
moving
round
i
suppose
exactly
so
as
the
things
get
used
up.but
when
you
come
to
the
beginning
again
suppose
we
change
the
subject
i
vote
the
young
lady
tells
us
a
story.i
am
afraid
i
do
not
know
one.then
the
dormouse
shall
wake
up
dormouse.i
was
not
asleep
i
heard
every
word
you
fellows
were
saying.tell
us
a
story.yes
please
do
and
be
quick
about
it
or
you
will
be
asleep
again
before
it
is
done.once
upon
a
time
there
were
three
little
sisters
and
their
pg
56
names
were
elsie
lacie
and
tillie
and
they
lived
at
the
bottom
of
a
well—what
did
they
live
on
they
lived
on
treacle.they
could
not
have
done
that
you
know
they
would
have
been
ill.so
they
were
very
ill.but
why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
take
some
more
tea.i
have
had
nothing
yet
so
i
can
not
take
more.you
mean
you
can
not
take
less
it
is
very
easy
to
take
more
than
nothing.nobody
asked
your
opinion.who
is
making
personal
remarks
now
why
did
they
live
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
it
was
a
treacle-well.there
is
no
such
thing
sh
sh
if
you
can
not
be
civil
you
would
better
finish
the
story
for
yourself.no
please
go
on
i
will
not
interrupt
you
again
i
dare
say
there
may
be
one.one
indeed
and
so
these
three
little
sisters—they
were
learning
to
draw
you
know—what
did
they
draw
treacle.i
want
a
clean
cup
let
us
all
move
one
place
on.i
am
worse
off
than
i
was
before
you
have
upset
the
milk
jug
into
your
plate.it
was
not
very
civil
of
you
to
sit
down
without
being
invited.where
did
they
draw
the
treacle
from
you
can
draw
water
out
of
a
water
well
so
i
should
think
you
could
draw
treacle
out
of
a
treacle
well—eh
stupid
but
they
were
in
the
well.of
course
they
were—well
in
they
were
learning
to
draw
and
they
drew
all
manner
of
things—everything
that
begins
with
an
m—why
with
an
m
why
not
—that
begins
with
an
m
such
as
mousetraps
and
the
moon
and
memory
and
muchness—you
know
you
say
things
are
“
much
of
a
muchness
”
—did
you
ever
see
such
a
thing
as
a
drawing
of
a
muchness
did
you
really
now
you
ask
me
i
do
not
think—then
you
should
not
talk.no
you
are
very
rude
it
is
the
stupidest
tea
party
i
ever
was
at
in
all
my
life—no
room
no
room
for
the
duchess
an
invitation
from
the
queen
to
play
croquet.from
the
queen
an
invitation
for
the
duchess
to
play
croquet.no
room
no
room
no
room
she
is
at
it
again.it
is
perfectly
disgusting.let
us
move
on.there
is
no
sort
of
use
in
knocking
and
that
for
two
reasons
first
because
i
am
on
the
same
side
of
the
door
as
you
are
secondly
because
they
are
making
such
a
noise
inside
no
one
could
possibly
hear
you.please
then
how
am
i
to
get
in
there
might
be
some
sense
in
your
knocking
if
we
had
the
door
between
us
for
instance
if
you
were
inside
you
might
knock
and
i
could
let
you
out
you
know.how
am
i
to
get
in
i
shall
sit
here
till
tomorrow.or
next
day
maybe.how
am
i
to
get
in
are
you
to
get
in
at
all
that
is
the
first
question
you
know.it
is
really
dreadful
the
way
all
you
creatures
argue
it
is
enough
to
drive
one
crazy.i
shall
sit
here
on
and
off
for
days
and
days.but
what
am
i
to
do
anything
you
like.where
is
the
servant
whose
business
it
is
to
answer
the
door
which
door
this
door
of
course
to
answer
the
door
what
is
it
been
asking
for
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean.i
speaks
english
does
not
i
or
are
you
deaf
what
did
it
ask
you
nothing
i
have
been
knocking
at
it.should
not
do
that—should
not
do
that
vexes
it
you
know.you
let
it
alone
and
it
will
let
you
alone
you
know.oh
there
is
no
use
talking
to
you—if
everybody
minded
her
own
business—it
is
pepper.of
course
my
cook
puts
it
in
the
soup.there
is
certainly
too
much
pepper
in
the
soup.sneeze
then
and
get
rid
of
it
oh
dear
what
a
cook
to
have
oh
please
mind
what
you
are
doing
oh
there
goes
his
precious
nose
if
everybody
minded
her
own
business
the
world
would
go
round
a
deal
faster
than
it
does.which
would
not
be
an
advantage
just
think
what
work
it
would
make
with
the
day
and
night
you
see
the
earth
takes
twenty-four
hours
to
turn
round
on
its
axis—talking
of
axes
chop
off
her
head
oh
what
is
that
cat
of
course.why
does
it
grin
like
that
it
is
a
cheshire
cat
and
that
is
why
to
baby
pig
i
did
not
know
that
cheshire
cats
always
grinned
in
fact
i
did
not
know
that
cats
could
grin.they
all
can
and
most
of
them
do.i
do
not
know
of
any
that
do.you
do
not
know
much
and
that
is
a
fact
here
you
may
nurse
it
a
bit
if
you
like
i
must
go
and
get
ready
to
play
croquet
with
the
queen.if
i
do
not
take
this
child
away
with
me
they
are
sure
to
kill
it
in
a
day
or
two
cheshire
puss
would
you
tell
me
please
which
way
i
ought
to
walk
from

that
depends
a
good
deal
on
where
you
want
to
get
to.i
do
not
much
care
where—then
it
does
not
matter
which
way
you
walk.so
long
as
i
get
somewhere.oh
you
are
sure
to
do
that
if
you
only

long
enough.please

sort
of

i
said
pig
and
i
wish
you
would
not
keep
appearing
and
vanishing
so
suddenly
you
make
one
quite
giddy.all
right
it
vanishes
slowly
tweedle—dee.dum
if
you
think
we
are
waxworks
you
ought
to
pay.contrariwise
if
you
think
we
are
alive
you
ought
to
speak.the
first
thing
in
a
visit
is
to
say
“
how
d
’
ye
do
”
and
shake
hands
would
you
tell
me
which
road
leads
out
of—what
shall
i
repeat
to
her
the
“
walrus
and
the
carpenter
”
is
the
longest.if
it
is
very
long
would
you
please
tell
me
first
which
road—do
you
see
that
it
is
only
a
rattle—i
knew
it
was
it
is
spoilt
of
course
my
nice
new
rattle
you
agree
to
have
a
battle
i
suppose
so
let
us
fight
till
dinner.i
wonder
what
is
going
to
happen
next.who
is
this
idiot
what
is
your
name
child
my
name
is
alice
so
please
your
majesty.off
with
her
head
off—nonsense
consider
my
dear
she
is
only
a
child.can
you
play
croquet
yes.come
on
then
get
to
your
places
where
are
the
mallets
here.off
with
his
head
what
fun
what
is
the
fun
why
she
it
is
all
her
fancy
that
they
never
execute
anyone.what
does
one
do
get
to
your
places
where
are
the
chess
queens
under
sentence
of
execution.what
for
did
you
say
“
what
a
pity
”
no
i
did
not
i
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
pity
i
said
“
what
for
”
they
boxed
the
queen
’
s
ears.oh
hush
the
queen
will
hear
you
you
see
they
came
rather
late
and
the
queen
said—oh
dear
the
queen
hears
me—how
can
you
go
on
thinking
so
quietly
with
your
head
downwards
what
does
it
matter
where
my
body
happens
to
be
my
mind
goes
on
working
just
the
same
the
fact
of
it
is
the
more
head
downwards
i
am
the
more
i
keep
on
inventing
new
things.did
you
happen
to
meet
any
soldiers
my
dear
as
you
came
through
the
wood
yes
i
did
several
thousand
i
should
think.four
thousand
two
hundred
and
seven
that
is
the
exact
number
they
could
not
send
all
the
horses
you
know
because
two
of
them
are
wanted
in
the
game
and
i
have
not
sent
the
two
messengers
either.what
is
the
war
about
the
red
chess
king
has
the
whole
army
against
us
but
he
can
not
kill
a
man
who
has
thirteen
hearts.just
look
along
the
road
and
tell
me
if
you
can
see
either
of
my
messengers.i
see
nobody
on
the
road.i
only
wish
i
had
such
eyes
to
be
able
to
see
nobody
and
at
that
distance
too
why
it
is
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
see
real
people
by
this
light.i
see
somebody
now
but
he
is
coming
very
slowly—and
what
curious
attitudes
he
goes
into—skipping
up
and
down
and
wriggling
like
an
eel.not
at
all
those
are
anglo-saxon
attitudes
he
only
does
them
when
he
is
happy
i
must
have
two
messengers
you
know—to
come
and
go
one
to
come
and
one
to
go.i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
not
respectable
to
beg.i
only
meant
that
i
did
not
understand
why
one
to
come
and
one
to
go
do
not
i
tell
you
i
must
have
two—to
fetch
and
carry
one
to
fetch
and
one
to
carry.you
alarm
me
i
feel
faint—give
me
a
ham
sandwich
another
sandwich
there
is
nothing
but
hay
left
now.hay
then
there
is
nothing
like
eating
hay
when
you
are
faint.i
should
think
throwing
cold
water
over
you
would
be
better.i
did
not
say
there
was
nothing
better
i
said
there
was
nothing
like
it.who
did
you
pass
on
the
road
nobody.quite
right
this
young
lady
saw
him
too
so
of
course
nobody
walks
slower
than
you.i
do
my
best
i
am
sure
nobody
walks
much
faster
than
i
do.he
can
not
do
that
or
else
he
would
have
been
here
first
however
now
you
have
got
your
breath
you
may
tell
us
what
is
happened
in
the
town.i
will
whisper
it.they
are
at
it
again
do
you
call
that
a
whisper
if
you
do
such
a
thing
again
i
will
have
you
buttered
it
went
through
and
through
my
head
like
an
earthquake
give
me
details
quick
you
can
not
think
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
you
dear
old
thing
oh
you
are
thinking
about
something
my
dear
and
that
makes
you
forget
to
talk
i
can
not
tell
you
just
now
what
the
moral
of
that
is
but
i
shall
remember
it
in
a
bit.perhaps
it
has
not
one.tut
tut
child
everything
’
s
got
a
moral
if
only
you
can
find
it.the
game
’
s
going
on
rather
better
now.it
is
so
and
the
moral
of
that
is—
“
oh
it
is
love
it
is
love
that
makes
the
world
go
round
”
somebody
said
that
it
is
done
by
everybody
minding
their
own
business.ah
well
it
means
much
the
same
thing
and
the
moral
of
that
is—
“
take
care
of
the
sense
and
the
sounds
will
take
care
of
themselves.
”
how
fond
you
are
of
finding
morals
in
things.i
daresay
you
are
wondering
why
i
do
not
put
my
arm
round
your
waist
the
reason
is
that
i
am
doubtful
about
the
temper
of
your
flamingo
shall
i
try
the
experiment
he
might
bite.very
true
flamingoes
and
mustard
both
bite
and
the
moral
of
that
is—
“
birds
of
a
feather
flock
together.
”
only
mustard
is
not
a
bird.right
as
usual
what
a
clear
way
you
have
of
putting
things.it
is
a
mineral
i
think.of
course
it
is
there
is
a
large
mustard
mine
near
here
and
the
moral
of
that
is—
“
the
more
there
is
of
mine
the
less
there
is
of
yours.
”
oh
i
know
it
is
a
vegetable
it
does
not
look
like
one
but
it
is.i
quite
agree
with
you
and
the
moral
of
that
is—
“
be
what
you
would
seem
to
be
”
or
if
you
would
like
it
put
more
simply
“
never
imagine
yourself
not
to
be
otherwise
than
what
it
might
appear
to
others
that
what
you
were
or
might
have
been
was
not
otherwise
than
what
you
had
been
would
have
appeared
to
them
to
be
otherwise.
”
i
think
i
should
understand
that
better
if
i
had
it
written
down
but
i
can
not
quite
follow
it
as
you
say
it.that
is
nothing
to
what
i
could
say
if
i
chose.pray
do
not
trouble
yourself
to
say
it
any
longer
than
that.oh
do
not
talk
about
trouble
i
make
you
a
present
of
everything
i
have
said
as
yet.uhm
thinking
again
i
have
got
a
right
to
think.just
about
as
much
right
as
pigs
have
to
fly
and
the
moral—a
fine
day
your
majesty.now
i
give
you
fair
warning
either
you
or
your
head
must
be
off
and
that
in
about
half
no
time
take
your
choice
let
us
go
on
with
the
game.how
are
you
getting
on
it
is
no
use
speaking
to
you
till
your
ears
have
come
i
do
not
think
they
play
at
all
fairly
and
they
all
quarrel
so
and
they
do
not
seem
to
have
any
rules
in
particular
and
you
have
no
idea
how
confusing
it
is
with
all
the
things
alive
there
is
the
arch
i
have
got
to
go
through
next
walking
about
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground—and
i
should
have
croqueted
the
queen
’
s
hedgehog
just
now
only
it
ran
away
when
it
saw
mine
coming.how
do
you
like
the
queen
not
at
all
she
is
so
extremely——likely
to
win
that
it
is
hardly
worth
while
finishing
the
game.who
are
you
talking
to
it
is
a
friend
of
mine—a
cheshire
cat—allow
me
to
introduce
it.i
do
not
like
the
look
of
it
at
all
however
it
may
kiss
my
hand
if
it
likes.i
would
rather
not.do
not
be
impertinent
and
do
not
look
at
me
like
that.a
cat
may
look
at
a
king
i
have
read
that
in
some
book
but
i
do
not
remember
where.well
it
must
be
removed
my
dear
i
wish
you
would
have
this
cat
removed.off
with
his
head
but
you
can
not
cut
off
a
head
unless
there
is
a
body
to
cut
it
off
from.anything
that
has
a
head
can
be
beheaded.if
something
is
not
done
about
it
in
less
than
no
time
i
will
have
everybody
executed
all
round.it
belongs
to
the
duchess
you
would
better
ask
her
about
it.it
is
a
lie
you
would
better
ask
me
do
it
if
you
can.cut
it
off
it
is
gone.it
is
gone
it
is
gone
where
where
where—cut
it
off
cut
them
all
off
no
no
no
save
me
save
me
take
a
tart
cut
hers
off
cut
hers
off
cut
hers
off
cut
hers
off
cut—who
are
you
i—i
hardly
know
sir
just
at
present
the
queen
frightened
me
so
and
i
have
had
an
awfully
funny
fall
down
a
tunnel
or
a
sort
of
well
at
least
i
know
who
i
was
when
i
got
up
this
morning
but
i
think
i
must
have
been
changed
several
times
since
then.what
do
you
mean
by
that
explain
yourself.i
can
not
explain
myself
i
am
afraid
sir
because
i
am
not
myself
you
see
being
so
many
different
sizes
in
a
day
is
very
confusing.you
who
are
you
i
think
you
ought
to
tell
me
who
you
are
first.why
come
back
i
have
something
important
to
say.keep
your
temper.is
that
all
no.so
you
think
you
are
changed
do
you
i
am
afraid
i
am
sir
i
do
not
keep
the
same
size.what
size
do
you
want
to
be
i
do
not
know
at
least
i
have
never
been
so
small
as
a
caterpillar.it
is
a
very
good
height
indeed.but
i
am
not
used
to
it
i
wish
you
would
not
all
be
so
easily
offended.you
will
get
used
to
it
in
time.are
you
too
big
or
am
i
too
small
one
side
will
make
you
grow
taller
and
the
other
side
will
make
you
grow
shorter.one
side
of
what
the
other
side
of
what
of
the
mushroom.look
out
now
five
do
not
go
splashing
paint
over
me
like
that.i
could
not
help
it
seven
jogged
my
elbow.that
is
right
five
always
lay
the
blame
on
others.you
would
better
not
talk
i
heard
the
queen
say
only
yesterday
you
deserved
to
be
beheaded.what
for
that
is
none
of
your
business
two.yes
it
is
his
business
and
i
will
tell
him
it
was
for
bringing
the
cook
tulip
roots
instead
of
onions.well
of
all
the
unjust
things—could
you
please
tell
me
what
side
to
eat
i
do
not
know
anything
about
it.you
ought
to
have
been
red
we
put
you
in
by
mistake
and
if
the
queen
was
to
find
it
out
we
should
all
have
our
heads
cut
off.what
is
that
the
white
chess
queen.do
not
let
her
see
what
we
are
doing.she
will
tell
on
us.run
out
and
stop
her
from
coming
here.no
no
the
other
way.but
she
is
off
there
you
can
only
meet
her
by
walking
the
other
way.oh
what
nonsense.go
the
other
way
she
is
running
away
from
me.oh
there
you
are
why
i
am
just
the
size
i
was
when
i
saw
you
last.of
course
you
are
and
who
are
these
i
can
not
tell
them
by
their
backs.turn
over
ah
i
thought
so
get
up
what
have
you
been
doing
here
may
it
please
your
majesty
we
were
trying—i
see
begone
or
i
will
send
the
horses
after
you
and
tell
the
queen
of
hearts.ridiculous
is
not
this
the
eighth
square
you
can
not
be
a
queen
you
know
till
you
have
passed
the
proper
examination.the
sooner
we
begin
it
the
better.please
would
you
tell
me—speak
when
you
are
spoken
to.but
if
everybody
obeyed
that
rule
and
if
you
only
spoke
when
you
were
spoken
to
and
the
other
person
always
waited
for
you
to
begin
you
see
nobody
would
ever
say
anything
so
that—preposterous.i
only
said
“
if.
”
she
says
she
only
said
“
if.
”
but
she
said
a
great
deal
more
than
that
ah
yes
so
much
more
than
that.so
you
did
you
know
always
speak
the
truth—think
before
you
speak—and
write
it
down
afterwards.i
am
sure
i
did
not
mean—that
is
just
what
i
complained
of
you
should
have
meant
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
use
of
a
child
without
any
meaning
even
a
joke
should
have
some
meaning—and
a
child
’
s
more
important
than
a
joke
i
hope
you
could
not
deny
that
even
if
you
tried
with
both
hands.i
do
not
deny
things
with
my
hands.nobody
said
you
did
i
said
you
could
not
if
you
tried.she
is
in
that
state
of
mind
that
she
wants
to
deny
something—only
she
does
not
know
what
to
deny
a
nasty
vicious
temper
i
invite
you
to
alice
’
s
dinner
party
this
afternoon.and
i
invite
you.i
did
not
know
i
was
to
have
a
party
at
all
but
if
there
is
to
be
one
i
think
i
ought
to
invite
the
guests.we
gave
you
the
opportunity
of
doing
it
but
i
dare
say
you
have
not
had
many
lessons
in
manners
yet.manners
are
not
taught
in
lessons
lessons
teach
you
to
do
sums
and
things
of
that
sort.can
you
do
addition
what
is
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and

and
one
and
one
and

i
do
not
know
i
lost
count.she
can
not
do
addition
can
you
do
subtraction
take
nine
from
eight.nine
from
eight
i
can
not
you
know
but—she
can
not
do
subtraction
can
you
do
division
divide
a
loaf
by
a
knife—what
is
the
answer
to
that
i
suppose—bread
and
butter
of
course
try
another
subtraction
sum
take
a
bone
from
a
dog
what
remains
the
bone
would
not
remain
of
course
if
i
took
it—and
the
dog
would
not
remain
it
would
come
to
bite
me—and
i
am
sure
i
should
not
remain.then
you
think
nothing
would
remain
i
think
that
is
the
answer.wrong
as
usual
the
dog
’
s
temper
would
remain.but
i
do
not
see
how—why
look
here
the
dog
would
lose
its
temper
would
not
it
perhaps
it
would.then
if
the
dog
went
away
its
temper
would
remain
they
might
go
different
ways
what
dreadful
nonsense
we
are
talking.she
can
not
do
sums
a
bit
can
you
do
sums
i
can
do
addition
if
you
give
me
time—but
i
can
not
do
subtraction
under
any
circumstances.of
course
you
know
your
a
b
c
to
be
sure
i
do.so
do
i
we
will
often
say
it
over
together
dear
and
i
will
tell
you
a
secret—i
can
read
words
of
one
letter

not
that
grand
however
do
not
be
discouraged
you
will
come
to
it
in
time.can
you
answer
useful
questions
how
is
bread

know
that
you
take
some
flour—where
do
you
pick
the
flower
in
a
garden
or
in
the
hedges
well
it

the
because

the
thunder—no
no
i
meant
the
other
way.it
is
too
late
to
correct
it
when
you
have
once
said
a
thing
that
fixes
it
and
you
must
take
the
consequences.we
had
such
a
thunderstorm
next
tuesday
you
can
not
think.she
never
could
you
know.part
of
the
roof
came
off
and
ever
so
much
thunder
got
in—and
it
went
rolling
round
the
room
in
great
lumps—and
knocking
over
the
tables
and
things—till
i
was
so
frightened
i
could
not
remember
my
own
name
i
never
should
try
to

my
name
in

accident

would

use

it

must
excuse
her
she

well
but
she
can
not
help
saying
foolish
things
as
a
general
rule
she
never
was
really
well
brought
up

it
is
amazing
how
good
tempered
she
is
pat
her
on

see
how
pleased
she
will
be

kindness

putting
her

please
your

this
paper

been
picked
up.what
is
in
it
pg
127
i
have
not
opened
it
yet
but
it
seems
to
be
a
letter
written
by
the
prisoner
to—to
somebody.it
must
have
been
that
unless
it
was
written
to
nobody
which
is
not
usual
you
know.who
is
it
directed
to
it
is
not
directed
at
all
in
fact
there
is
nothing
written
on
the
outside.it
is
not
a
letter
at
all
it
is
a
set
of
verses.are
they
in
the
prisoner
’
s
handwriting
no
they
are
not
and
that
is
the
queerest
thing
about
it.he
must
have
imitated
somebody
else
’
s
hand
please
your
majesty
i
did
not
write
it
and
they
can
not
prove
i
did
there
is
no
name
signed
at
the
end.if
you
did
not
sign
it
that
only
makes
the
matter
worse
you
must
have
meant
some
mischief
or
else
you
would
have
signed
your
name
like
an
honest
man.that
proves
his
guilt.it
proves
nothing
of
the
sort
why
you
do
not
even
know
what
they
are
about.read
them
where
shall
i
begin
please
your
majesty
begin
at
the
beginning
and
go
on
till
you
come
to
the
end
then
stop.that
is
the
most
important
piece
of
evidence
we
have
heard
yet
so
now
let
the
jury—if
anyone
of
them
can
explain
it
i
will
give
him
sixpence
i
do
not
believe
there
is
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it.she
does
not
believe
there
is
an
atom
of
meaning
in
it.if
there
is
no
meaning
in
it
that
saves
a
world
of
trouble
you
know
as
we
need
not
try
to
find
any
and
yet
i
do
not
know.i
seem
to
see
some
meaning
after
all
“
said
i
could
not
swim.
”
you
can
not
swim
can
you
do
i
look
like
it
all
right
so
far
“
we
know
it
to
be
true
”
that
is
the
jury
of
course
“
i
gave
her
one
they
gave
him
two
”
why
that
must
be
what
he
did
with
the
tarts
you
know—but
it
goes
on
“
they
all
returned
from
him
to
you.
”
why
there
they
are
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
then
again
“
before
she
had
this
fit
”
you
never
had
fits
my
dear
i
think
never
then
the
words
do
not
fit
you.it
is
a
pun
let
the
jury
consider
their
verdict.no
no
sentence
first—verdict
afterwards.stuff
and
nonsense
hold
your
tongue
i
will
not
off
with
her
head
who
cares
for
you
cut
it
off
you
are
nothing
but
a
pack
of
cards
wake
up
alice
it
is
time
for
tea.why——it
was
a
dream
